SciML is a NumFOCUS sponsored open source software organization created to unify the packages for scientific machine learning. This includes the development of modular scientific simulation support software, such as differential equation solvers, along with the methodologies for inverse problems and automated model discovery. By providing a diverse set of tools with a common interface, we provide a modular, easily-extendable, and highly performant ecosystem for handling a wide variety of scientific simulations.
